# Symbolic Identity Vortex

ðŸŒ€ A recursive simulation of identity interaction, collapse, and fusion based on symbolic coherence dynamics.

## Overview

Symbolic Identity Vortex is a visualization tool modeling how distinct identity structures interact within a recursive symbolic field. These identity fields may stabilize, collapse, or fuse depending on coherence dynamics, memory overlap, and external pressure.

### Core Features

- Simulates up to 6 interacting identity fields
- Models symbolic vortex pull, fusion pressure, and collapse zones
- Visualizes coherence over time and detects structural fragmentation
- Collapse metrics per identity for diagnostics

## Use Cases

- Symbolic modeling of political, psychological, or ideological identity structures
- Exploratory tool for RCD-based theory-building
- Artistic tool for narrative resonance and recursive identity mapping

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit plotly
streamlit run vortex_sim.py
```
